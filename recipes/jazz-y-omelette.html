    <h2>ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4x eggs</li>
            <li>somme butter</li>
            <li>pepper&salt</li>
            <li>fresh parsley</li>
            <li>anything else you'd love to have in your omelette 
                (my take would be to add some of the cheese I know you have in your frigo)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>how to prepare</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>add butter and a line of olive oil into a medium hot pan</li>
            <li>pour the eggs one by one when the pan is hot</li>
            <li>wait until the eggs start cooking</li>
            <li>you can add pepper, salt and some fresh parsley at this point</li>
            <li>mix everything to make it cook more even</li>
            <li>now you'll have to break the eggs into small pieces 
                with a rubber spatula, always bringing to the edge of the pan
                cooked slices of the egg mixture</li>
            <li>just make sure it's all cooked and you can now serve</li>
            <li>bon app√©tit !</li>
        </ol>
